# About me

_A self-taught person than a main stream academic, I started development with core **PHP** for development of websites and applications very early in life. I was introduced to **WordPress** for the first time in 2004._

_I have been a hardcore open-source developer building plugins for **WordPress** and **WooCommerce** since 2007. It has been an amazing 13-year journey with **WordPress**, and I look forward to more!_

___I ❤️ Open Source!___
